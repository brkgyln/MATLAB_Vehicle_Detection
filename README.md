## Visual Recognition and Detection of Cars implemented in MATLAB
---
#### Key words:
* VLFeat: Used HOG to find the shape in the picture
* LIBSVM: Trained SVM with positive and negative samples to generate a SVM model for testing
* Adaptive background: Used to find cars that are not moving
* Piramid scanning: Sampled the picture with changing unit size, and normalized all the samples
* Visual result: Generated a new video clip that marks (almost) all the cars with rectangulars
